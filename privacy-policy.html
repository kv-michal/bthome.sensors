  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 14 February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>BTHome Sensors</strong> is handled
    by its developer, <strong>Michal Koval</strong>, and explains what data is
    collected, how it is used, and your rights under applicable data protection
    laws, including the GDPR.
  </p>

  <h2>1. About the App</h2>
  <p>
    BTHome Sensors uses Bluetooth to scan nearby devices that implement the
    BTHome protocol. Sensor data is displayed in graphs and stored locally on
    your device for a user-defined period. The app may optionally receive data
    in the background when enabled by the user.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage and Processing</h2>
  <p>
    All sensor data and history are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.
    This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to the developer’s
    servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can delete all locally stored data at any time using the in-app controls.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Collected Automatically</h2>
  <p>
    The app itself does not collect personal data such as names, email addresses,
    or user-generated content.
  </p>

  <p>
    Limited technical data may be processed by third-party services used to
    improve app stability:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Device identifiers</strong> (such as an anonymous device ID) are
      used by analytics and crash reporting tools.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Crash diagnostics</strong> may be collected when the app crashes
      to help identify and fix bugs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses the following third-party services:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expo</strong> – application framework and runtime</li>
    <li><strong>PostHog</strong> – anonymous usage analytics</li>
    <li><strong>Sentry</strong> – crash reporting and diagnostics</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These services may process limited technical information in accordance with
    their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    BTHome Sensors may request the following permissions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bluetooth</strong> – to scan and communicate with BTHome devices</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong> – required by iOS for Bluetooth scanning</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong> – to optionally notify you about sensor events</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Permissions are used only for their intended functionality and can be
    revoked at any time in iOS system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    The app does <strong>not</strong> display advertisements and does
    <strong>not</strong> use tracking for advertising purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    BTHome Sensors is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.
    The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights (EU / GDPR)</h2>
  <p>
    As an EU user, you have the right to access, delete, or restrict the use of
    your data. Since all user data is stored locally on your device, these rights
    can be exercised directly within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the
    developer at:
